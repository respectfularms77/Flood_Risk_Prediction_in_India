# 🌊 Flood Risk Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on **Flood Risk Prediction** as part of the *Climate Risk and Disaster Management* domain.  
Flooding has become one of the most critical natural disasters, especially in regions like India, where heavy rainfall and rising river levels often lead to devastating impacts on lives and infrastructure.  
The objective of this project is to explore, analyze, and build a foundation for predicting flood risks using historical data.
